# Beginner

You must master these levels before you can create your own Java programs.
At this level, you will learn the fundamentals of Java and how to get started creating Java applications.


 - Level 1 (JDK, Maven, IDE, Environment)
 - Level 2 (Class, BigDecimal, Integer, operations, Switch, If, String, StringBuilder)
 - Level 3 (OOP, Date, String, List, Tree, Recursion)



## Level 1 (Java, Maven, IDE, Environment)

### 1. Choose a IDE

IDE is the tool that you will use to write your Java code. 

I recommend you to use Intellij:

IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software written in Java.

But you can also use Eclispe, or Visual Studio.


### 2. Install Maven and write what is it.


https://maven.apache.org/

PS: You can also use gradle if you prefer.

### 3. Install Java and configure JAVA_HOME


https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html


### 4. Be aware of Java Roadmap, and choose the lastest LTS version

Oracle Java SE Product Releases

### 5. Hello World application.

#### Problem:

You should create a maven project, with a Main class with a main method to show on the console "Hello World"

#### Solution:


## Level 2 (Console, Double, Integer, BigDecimal, Recursion, Switch, Loop, If, OOP, String)


### 1. Console World application.

#### Problem:

You should create a project, that will receive a value from the console and will print it.

#### Solution:


### 2. Calculator

#### Problem:

You should create a maven project, with a Calculator class. The calculator class should contains 4 operations, addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. You should get two numbers from the console and the operation, then run the calculation and return the result.


#### Solution:


### 3. Update Calculator

#### Problem:

You should update your calculation to support decimal values, use Decimal and then change it to BigDecimal, try with big numbers to see the difference. 


#### Solution:


### 4. Decimal Calculator

#### Problem:

You should update your calculation to support decimal values, use Decimal and then change it to BigDecimal, try with big numbers to see the difference. 


#### Solution:


### 5. User Calculator

Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop.



#### Solution:



### 7. Matches Word


#### Problem:


Write a program that takes in a string and a word, and returns the number of occurrences of the word in the string.


#### Solution:


### 8. OOP

#### Problem:


You know you should study object-oriented programming (OOP). You should know about the 4 pillars. Write down what the 4 pillars are.


#### Solution:




### Level 3 (OOP, File, Date, String, StringBuilder)



### 1. Employees Salary

#### Problem:

Create a class to calculate the salary of the employees, it should receive the number of hours, the value of the salary per hour, and then multiplied. Don't forget to tax it by 20%. You should also create the employees class.

#### Solution:

### 4. Split Strings


#### Problem:

Write a function that splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']

#### Solution:

#### Solution:


### 5. Determine the date by the day number

#### Problem:
