At this level you will learn how to create your first API Rest, authentication and also database.



## Level 1 


### 1. Tree recursion

#### Problem:

You must create a tree. Create a class called Tree, the Three will contain branches, each branch can have a leaf and another branch. Create a method to fill in your three, at least up to 4th level, and a method to print all the sheets. Use recursion to solve it.

```
class Branch{
	private String leaf;
	private Branch branch;
}
```

#### Solution:
